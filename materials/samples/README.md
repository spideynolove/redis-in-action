Let's make this absolutely clear. Russia Invaded Crimea, where the world did nothing, then
Russia again Invaded Ukraine.

If you support Russia's efforts in Ukraine, you can fuck off. I don't care where you come from,
what your nationality, religion, etc. is, you can fuck off. No, for real. YOU DO NOT GET A LICENSE
IF YOU AGREE WITH THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.
